Basic-Meta-Templates
====================
### Description
A collection of template types that can help with metaprogramming C++.</br>
### How to use
Add lib "include" to compiler (-I"include/") and once include implementation "src/bmt/bmt.cpp" to main (or another) cpp file.
Ready! Now just add "#include <bmt/bmt.hpp>" where it needs. (also don't forget to add the flag -std=c++20 or higher)
### Post Scriptum
At the moment, this library is more of a pet project, with a possible foundation for the future.</br>
As I gain more experience in programming in C++, I will add new tools that could theoretically be useful in other projects.</br>
I also do not rule out the possibility that I have created a library of “crooked bicycles”.
I am by no means a qualified specialist. This library is the product of a self-taught amateur who likes to solve abstract puzzles.</br>
At the moment the code is badly documented (no examples), so I'm going to create a few more libraries ("pet projects") for debugging.
After that, I will add html/md documentation.
